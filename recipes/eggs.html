        <h2>Description</h2>
            Use this recipe for perfectly cooked hard-boiled eggs. By adding a little vinegar and salt, the eggshell peels off so easily without tearing or sticking. I have been making them this way for years!
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring the salt, vinegar, and water to a boil. </li>
            <li>Gently boil the eggs for about 14 minutes. </li>
            <li>Transfer the eggs to ice water.</li>
            <li>Once cooled, peel the eggs. </li>
        </ol>
