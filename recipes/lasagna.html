    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Meat:</strong> This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).</li>
            <li><strong>Onion:</strong> A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</li>
            <li><strong>Canned Tomates</strong>You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.</li>
            <li><strong>Fresh Herbs:</strong>For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar</strong>A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.</li>
            <li><strong>Spices</strong>This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.</li>
            <li><strong>Noodles</strong>Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.</li>
            <li><strong>Cheese</strong>The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.</li>
            <li><strong>Eggs</strong>Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).</li>
        
        </ul>
